## Analysis of Kaggle's Seattle Airbnb Dataset for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree (Project 1)

Using [Kaggle's Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/notebook) with the aid of Python and Power BI, this project seeks to answer the following questions:
* What is the average listing Price based on Location/Seattle Neighborhood?
* What is the occupancy pattern based on Weekday and season?
* How do hosts with high performance compare to hosts with low performance? Based on this, how can hosts with low performance increase their performance ratings?
* What are some of the factors that determine price?
